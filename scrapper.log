This device is simply outstanding, and I can't imagine my life without it now.First and foremost, the audio quality is impressive. The speaker produces rich, clear sound that fills the room with music. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlists or asking Alexa to play the news or podcasts, the audio experience is always top-notch. The bass is deep, and the trebles are crisp, resulting in a well-balanced sound profile.The voice recognition capabilities of Alexa are exceptional. She accurately picks up my voice commands even when I'm across the room or playing music at higher volumes. It's a joy to interact with Alexa, who responds promptly and provides useful information or performs tasks effortlessly. From setting reminders and alarms to checking the weather or controlling my smart home devices, Alexa is like a personal assistant always at my beck and call.I also appreciate the sleek and modern design of the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen. Its compact size allows it to fit seamlessly into any room without taking up too much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it aesthetically pleasing and blending well with my home decor.The setup process was a breeze. It took me just a few minutes to connect the speaker to my Wi-Fi network and link it to my Amazon account. The intuitive Alexa app guided me through the process step by step, ensuring a seamless setup experience.One feature I particularly enjoy is the integration with other smart devices. I can effortlessly control my compatible lights, thermostats, and even my TV using voice commands through Alexa. It has truly made my home smarter and more convenient.In terms of privacy, Amazon has made great strides in addressing concerns. The ability to mute the microphone easily provides peace of mind when I don't want Alexa listening in. I appreciate the transparency and control Amazon offers in this regard.Overall, the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen smart speaker is a phenomenal addition to any home.

Bought it on Sep 26, 2022.Btw, on the left side on the body, near the screen, the paint had been chipped off (microscopic level). Had complained to the Amazon customer service, but of no avail. 6 months later...........1.  The Externals:  Build Quality: Apart from the earlier niggle, a well put together phone. The familiar glass sandwich design. It is pretty light to hold and because of the squared design, feels really comfortable to hold. I\'m not a fan of big phones, so this size is a perfect sweet spot. The buttons also feel really tactile, no wobbles whatsoever. The alert slider is really a blessing! a real convenient thing to have. I guess every manufacturer apart from Oneplus has to implement this.  And then, the IP68. I haven\'t got a chance to take underwater photos, so yeah, It\'s a safe thing!  Screen: It is a beautiful display to watch on. Supports HDR and Dolby vision as well. Inky blacks and punchy colors: a treat for movie lovers!. ( Btw, I dont like to watch movies on phones)  Speakers: Dual front firing speakers. Loud, clear. No distortion even at high volumes. Doesn\'t have much of a bass but a really enjoyable one. Calls are crystal clear if there isn\'t any signal interference.  Cameras: It takes good quality photos with the rear as well as front cameras. In daylight, the photos look rich and crisp, details are really spot on, the colors look really natural, skin tones produced are natural. Night time photos too look really good. Night mode does make a difference. Considering it\'s a flagship from 2020, these things are really expected and it does deliver. I really don\'t have anything to comment about the video, It\'s splendid!.... just that.2. The Internals.  Battery life: Still at 100% health(not a real thing to worry about, but just saying). On iOS 15, it used to be stellar, I usually get about 5.30 hrs at 50% battery and still there\'ll be about another 50% to spare. But on iOS 16, I only get about half the battery I used to get on iOS 15. (About 5-6 hours at 100% usage). I really hope this would change in the future with the upcoming updates, but at present, I\'m not happy about it.  iOS & Performance : The A14 bionic is a beast. Apps open up in a jiffy. Not much of a gamer, but the games do play without a hint of lag. iOS is a fresh experience for me. But then there are many "must have" things that I miss here that I used in Android, like call recording(it\'s a must have feature, you never know when it\'ll be a life saver!), The performance and the overall fluidity of the system took a hit when I updated to iOS 16, but slowly, it\'s getting better over time with updates, (now on iOS 16.4) But, much more refinements to be done, a lot of bugs to be fixed!Some general things : 5G is working fine. Getting good speeds just like the carriers advertised, signal reception is good. Heats up a bit (Culprit- iOS 16, haven\'t noticed on iOS 15)\n'}]

Night mode does make a difference. Considering it\'s a flagship from 2020, these things are really expected and it does deliver. I really don\'t have anything to comment about the video, It\'s splendid!.... just that.2. The Internals.  Battery life: Still at 100% health(not a real thing to worry about, but just saying). On iOS 15, it used to be stellar, I usually get about 5.30 hrs at 50% battery and still there\'ll be about another 50% to spare. But on iOS 16, I only get about half the battery I used to get on iOS 15. (About 5-6 hours at 100% usage). I really hope this would change in the future with the upcoming updates, but at present, I\'m not happy about it.  iOS & Performance : The A14 bionic is a beast. Apps open up in a jiffy. Not much of a gamer, but the games do play without a hint of lag. iOS is a fresh experience for me. But then there are many "must have" things that I miss here that I used in Android, like call recording(it\'s a must have feature, you never know when it\'ll be a life saver!), The performance and the overall fluidity of the system took a hit when I updated to iOS 16, but slowly, it\'s getting better over time with updates, (now on iOS 16.4) But, much more refinements to be done, a lot of bugs to be fixed!Some general things : 5G is working fine. Getting good speeds just like the carriers advertised, signal reception is good.

You want to open a notification? Swipe FIRST and then click open.. like wth????????3. DON\'T believe Apple fanboys who scream about speed, Android phones are equally snappy in performance today. There are split second app loading times in iOS also, just like in Android. And yeah iOS DOES HAVE occasional bugs too, apps taking too much time sometimes etc etc.4. FaceID is nice but an in-fingerprint reader seems the best ID to me atleast, that\'s missing.5. Ridiculously expensive accessories6. Battery life is above good but not great.In the end I would say iPhone, overall, does provide a better experience (mostly cuz of hardware only) but it\'s expensive. Do know that you\'re NOT buying a value-for-money phone at all, so buy it only if you can afford it without much difficulty.\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'mahesh krishnan', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'First step into the ecosystem!', 'review': '\nI have been a smartphone user since 2015, used both windows and android, finally into iOS too. Bought it on Sep 26, 2022.Btw, on the left side on the body, near the screen, the paint had been chipped off (microscopic level). Had complained to the Amazon customer service, but of no avail. 6 months later...........1.  The Externals:  Build Quality: Apart from the earlier niggle, a well put together phone. The familiar glass sandwich design. It is pretty light to hold and because of the squared design, feels really comfortable to hold. I\'m not a fan of big phones, so this size is a perfect sweet spot. The buttons also feel really tactile, no wobbles whatsoever. The alert slider is really a blessing! a real convenient thing to have. I guess every manufacturer apart from Oneplus has to implement this.  And then, the IP68. I haven\'t got a chance to take underwater photos, so yeah, It\'s a safe thing!  Screen: It is a beautiful display to watch on. Supports HDR and Dolby vision as well. Inky blacks and punchy colors: a treat for movie lovers!. ( Btw, I dont like to watch movies on phones)  Speakers: Dual front firing speakers. Loud, clear. No distortion even at high volumes. Doesn\'t have much of a bass but a really enjoyable one. Calls are crystal clear if there isn\'t any signal interference.  Cameras: It takes good quality photos with the rear as well as front cameras. In daylight, the photos look rich and crisp, details are really spot on, the colors look really natural, skin tones produced are natural. Night time photos too look really good. Night mode does make a difference. Considering it\'s a flagship from 2020, these things are really expected and it does deliver. I really don\'t have anything to comment about the video, It\'s splendid!.... just that.2. The Internals.  Battery life: Still at 100% health(not a real thing to worry about, but just saying). On iOS 15, it used to be stellar, I usually get about 5.30 hrs at 50% battery and still there\'ll be about another 50% to spare. But on iOS 16, I only get about half the battery I used to get on iOS 15. (About 5-6 hours at 100% usage). I really hope this would change in the future with the upcoming updates, but at present, I\'m not happy about it.  iOS & Performance : The A14 bionic is a beast. Apps open up in a jiffy. Not much of a gamer, but the games do play without a hint of lag. iOS is a fresh experience for me. But then there are many "must have" things that I miss here that I used in Android, like call recording(it\'s a must have feature, you never know when it\'ll be a life saver!), The performance and the overall fluidity of the system took a hit when I updated to iOS 16, but slowly, it\'s getting better over time with updates, (now on iOS 16.4) But, much more refinements to be done, a lot of bugs to be fixed!Some general things : 5G is working fine. Getting good speeds just like the carriers advertised, signal reception is good. Heats up a bit (Culprit- iOS 16, haven\'t noticed on iOS 15)\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'amit gautam', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'On time delivery', 'review': '\nGreat product from great service provider\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Raktim phukan', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Good product', 'review': '\nHappy with the product\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Sourav Sinha', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Wow', 'review': '\nCamera beast\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Siddhartha Singha maha patra', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Good', 'review': '\nGood service and good phone\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Debashis Tripz', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Little bit lag', 'review': '\nSlight Lag while playing bgmi\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 12 (64GB) - White', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/New-Apple-iPhone-12-64GB/dp/B08L5VJYV7/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone12&qid=1688919123&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'RD', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Using it', 'review': '\nNo complain\n'}]

I hate Iphones. I used to have an work phone (Iphone SE).Being a Sony Xperia user since Sony Arc times, I didn't have a choice to move away form the Sony portfolio as they don't sell in India anymore. My XZ1 is still working after 5.5 years, but she is getting old. And I repeat I hate IPhones.After much deliberation between 12, 13 and 13 Mini, I went with 13 Mini.1. I really wanted a phone I could use in a single hand, it fits perfect.2. I got a great deal on the purchase, as the net amt I paid was Rs. 58,900 after card discounts. So it is cheaper than a lot of Android phones with high end configuration.3. Performance. It is smooth and fast.4. Face Id works. I don't like it, but it works, I miss the Touch Id, but i knew what I was getting. So no complains.5. The Starlight colour is beautiful. I love whites.6. Camera is brilliant. I am a point shoot, not a camera buff. My Sony XZ1 Camera is 5 years outdates, so this is refreshing.7. The only pain point is inability to transfer Whatsapp from Android to IPhone. I knew this, so not a surprise. But still a pain.8. Sound. I come from a XZ1 front Stereo experience. Not many phones have that sound quality. This phone is top quality. So I am satisfied with the quality.9. Display. I still love LCD panels. But this is pretty sharp and bright. I love it.10. Notch. It doesn't hurt my eyes. So I don't really care. Again, I knew what I was getting.If you are a power user and concerned about battery, having a power bank may be useful, but I feel it shouldn't be a problem for normal users.\n"}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 13 Mini (256GB) - Pink', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-13-Mini-256GB/dp/B09G9BJK4X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone13&qid=1688920549&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Abhimanyu Shrivastav', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'The best compact smartphone, and the best iPhone model', 'review': '\nPros:Form factor is unmatched. There is literally no other phone in the market that offers the same combination of ease of use, pocketability and performance. It\'s a joy to use one handed.Battery life is amazing compared to most android flagships, not as good as the iPhone Pro Max, but still more than sufficient.Performance is snappy. No stutters, lags or freezes whatsoever.Display is great. High resolution combined with small screen size means fantastic density. No high refresh rate though.Cameras are OK, I\'m not a photography enthusiast, but they\'re good enough for point and click. Not as good as my Note20 Ultra, but doable.Cons:iOS is a mixed bag. I get the distinct impression that it\'s been designed with the intention that the end user has to adapt to its quirks rather than opposite. Personally, I prefer that I can customise an OS for my usage rather than me adapting to it, but some people prefer it that way.Repairs are exorbitantly expensive. A case and a protector is absolutely necessary.Apple accessories are usually more expensive than competing products without necessarily offering extra.If you\'re going to use this as a primary device for media consumption, see the phone in-person first. The display is small, and you might find it smaller than you expected.Overall, I feel given Apple\'s "walled garden" nature, most of the iPhones are better suited as communication devices rather than media and entertainment ones. And if you just want an iPhone that works flawlessly for calls, texts, emails and social media, the iPhone 13 mini is the best model in the entire iPhone range.\n'}, {'product': 'Apple iPhone 13 Mini (256GB) - Pink', 'prod_link': 'https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-13-Mini-256GB/dp/B09G9BJK4X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=iphone13&qid=1688920549&sr=8-1', 'reviewer_name': 'Akhilesh K.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'title': 'Last of the small phones', 'review': '\nI needed to upgrade from iPhone 7 . But am not comfortable with large phones and needed something similar in size to iPhone 7 . With iPhone 14 series not having a mini , I realised this was my last chance to get hands on a small iPhone by buying the previous mini series . After much research , I went for iPhone 13 mini red 256 GB . This phone is smaller than iPhone 7 in overall dimensions but has a larger screen than the 7 . So , reasonably satisfied with the size .

Credit to apple for making a powerful device with such an extraordinary build and Smooth running OS with tons of great features. Listing down all the pros and cons of iphone 13 miniPros:1. Amazing camera. Image quality is great. Cinematic mode works brilliantly. Have been shooting lot of videos as well.2. Face ID is superfast. Just glance on your phone and it gets unlocked. Though face ID gives up when you wear a face mask.3. Shortcuts are brilliant. Use it to know about it. Makes my life much easier.4. OS runs exceedingly smooth5. Set modes daily based on your schedule.6. Battery is excellent. Runs for more than a day with heavy usage in a single charge.7. Small size makes it very easy to keep to hold and keep in the pocket.Cons1. Gets heated up during charging when some apps are running in the background2. No fingerprint sensor. Makes life difficult when you’re out wearing a mask and face ID doesn’t work.3. No charger available. Comes only with usb cable.4. Won’t feel great when you watch a movie or play a high end game because of the phone size.(PS: It’s a personal opinion. Others might not agree)Overall a great purchase and a powerful device fulfilling all your smartphone needs👏🏼\n'}]
